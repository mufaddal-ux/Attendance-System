# Attendance-System
In  this project at start we have two interface a student login or admin login. First admin registers a student and mark their attendance while students can see his\her attendance after giving username and password provided by admin. Their is a login window for admin also.Here admin can delete students data or can check student attendance by roll number or name and admin can also get a list of all students present.This all things are possible due to file handling there are two main files which is"db.txt" and "attend.txt" and also no two students with same username or roll number can be registered as it will gave error
